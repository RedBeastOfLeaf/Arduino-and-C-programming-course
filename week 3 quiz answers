1. What is the function of the linking process after compilation?
Ans: It merges the libraries with the application code into a single executable
2. What is the role of avrdude?
Ans: It writes the executable into the memory of the Arduino
3. Why are classes (in C++) useful?
Ans: They improve the organization and understandability of the code
4. What is one way that a sketch can invoke a function contained inside a class?
Ans: The name of the class can be concatenated with the name of the function, with a period in between.
5. Which of the following statements is true?
